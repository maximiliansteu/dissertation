      "Reasoning: The tweet presents information that is not entirely new or sudden, as the spread of COVID-19 has been widely reported on in the media. However, the mention of the lack of diagnostic equipment in many countries is a slightly unexpected perspective. The advice to use natural vitamin C to strengthen the immune system is not a groundbreaking suggestion and has been widely discussed in relation to other illnesses and diseases. Overall, the tweet contains some unique phrasing, but it does not shake up the reader's usual way of thinking in a significant way, resulting in a novelty score of 2.\n",
